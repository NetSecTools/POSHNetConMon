# POSHNetConMon
The goal of this project is to create a way to monitor network traffic from any Windows machine in an easy to use manner. 
Without the installation or utilization of any external tools. This allows any Windows machine to become a connection monitor, 
with an easily viewable GUI to monitor network connections which may or may not be malicious. On many networks and machines, 
you are unable to install third-party tools or run third-party executables, all of which GUI based network monitors currently use. 
By using Powershell we are able to bypass the usual restrictions placed on a Windows machine to see inbound and outbound traffic in an easy to read fashion.
